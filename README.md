# risk-assessment-cisco
This repository contains my full risk assessment project conducted on the organization Cisco for my university (and for myself since I like this) The objective of this project is to analyze Cisco's inner workings, identify potential risks and threats in Cisco's cloud, software, hardware and network products and services.

The project overview:
As a Senior Security Architect, you have been tasked with conducting a comprehensive security assessment of a multi-tier web application used by your chosen organization. The application processes sensitive data, integrates with third-party APIs, and runs on a cloud infrastructure. You are free to select any industry or organization as the context (e.g., banking, e-commerce, healthcare). 
You must create a complete security assessment that demonstrates your ability to think like an attacker while maintaining the perspective of a defender. This is not a checkbox exercise – you need to demonstrate deep understanding of how threats propagate through complex systems. 

Organization chosen: Cisco
Since Cisco is a large organization providing lots of different services and products with numerous partnerships and their sourcing and manifacturing operations being completely outsourced (A very large supply chain) I will be focusing on specific sectors or services that Cisco provides and build our way up to see how risk's in said areas can spread out and affect other sectors and Cisco as a whole. I will be adding dates through both formal and informal walkthroughs, to help the reader understand the context and time this risk assessment has been conducted, as well as give space for future observations and extensions to this project. 
I have not decided which methods exactly I will be using to assess their risks but for now I will be building their internal infastructure. The regulatory requirements will be SOC 2 and NIST CSF 2
